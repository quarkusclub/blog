description: "In this talk, you'll learn how the MCP (Model Context Protocol) enables Java backends to practically and intelligently communicate with large language models like GPT. We'll explore fundamental concepts, build an MCP server and client in Java using Spring AI, and understand how this approach can transform your backend into an intelligent agent capable of executing business logic with natural language commands. Ideal for anyone looking to connect Java with the future of AI."
